#        All numbers are in hex format
#        We always start by reset signal (in phase one, it just reset all registers)
#         This is a commented line
#        You should ignore empty lines and commented ones
#         add as much NOPs as you want to avoid hazards (as a software solution, just in 
#          phase one)
# ---------- Don't forget to Reset before you start anything ---------- #
